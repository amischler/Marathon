* Fixed: MEditorPane#click is not clicking on the links in a HTML document
1. MEditorPane is overriding the wrong click. Fixed.

* Fixed: NPE in MTabbedPane
1. When a tab contains only an icon without a title an NPE is being raised in getText(). MTabbedPane is modified to
   return a tab name using the icon or index in this case.
2. Getting the filename from image description in PropertyWrapper is made a static helper function
3. Added tests for TabbedPane with icons.

[2011-07-04]
* Fixed: More than one component matched error for default OptionPane

[2011-06-28]
* Fixed: UT failures in TestObjectMapConfiguration
1. Default configuration changes caused failures in UTs that have been fixed.

* Updated: Naming components with same properties
1. ObjectMapNamingStrategy now appends an index to the highest-priority-created-name instead of using
the last resort properties in case of duplicate names.
2. Default configuration is changed so that both recognition and naming properties are same except for
an addition of 'type' in recognition properties.

* Change: Loading default omap configuration. Created a default file instead of hardcoded properties.


[2011-06-27]
* Update: Added strict/loose mode for ObjectMapNamingStrategy
1. Added a flag to set the ObjectMapNamingStrategy resolve mode to strict/loose. In strict mode, an error
is thrown whenever a component is not found in the objectmap while playing even when the component exists
in the runtime naming cache.


[2011-06-23]
* Fixed: File separator char not being replaced by dot on windows in import module statements.


[2011-06-21]
* Fixed: Components in tabs getting recorded with same names.

1. OMapContainer is saving the contents even when it is not accessed and components are not loaded.

* Fixed: reverted earlier CNF fix and redid it in getContainer

* Fixed:
1. Setting up unit-tests target system property 'marathon.naming.strategy' so the UTs pass.


[2011-06-20]
* Fixed:
1. Components that do not exist in object map throws CNF exception while playing the scripts.


[2011-06-18]
* Fixed:
1. Added MarathonMode (Recording, Other). Skip saving ObjectMap if it is not in recording mode.

* Fixed Bugs:
1. A toggle button will be recorded always. This is required for recording state when the toggle buttons are used
as toolbar buttons as in SwingSet2 sample.

* Fixed Bug:
1. SwingSet2 example: keystroke SHIFT+F10 opens a popup menu, but it disappears before the menu item is selected while
playing. This happens only on Windows. The reason being that the release event posted (on the old component) is causing
the focus to change (guess). Fixed it by checking that the component focus did not change before posting the release
event.


[2011-06-17]
* Fixed UTs for changed in Navigator interface

* Fixed Bugs:
1. NPE in DisplayWindow when MarathonITE commands are invoked without an active editor.

* Fixed Bugs.
1. CheckListDialog: Label when adding Header/Checklist/Textbox
2. Navigator: Error message when deleting root directory
3. PropertyWrapper: Removed sop
4. PropertyWrapper: Fixed NPE in findLabel()
5. ObjectMapNamingStrategy: When a label returns null for getText() the "null" string is used in names.
6. DisplayWindow: rawRecord button selected state icon is added.

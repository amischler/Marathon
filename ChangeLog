* Changed readme.txt to README.txt and added textile and html versions.
* LogManager#readConfiguration() is being called after setProperties, so that if user overrides the log configuration file it is read and added logging.properties file.
* Fixed: OMapContainer#createFileName() prefixes the title and if the title is too long a IOException is thrown. Now we consider only the first 64 characters of the title.
